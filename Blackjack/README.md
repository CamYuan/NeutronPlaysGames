TODO: Convert to Json... why wasn't I doing this to begin with?
TODO: implement double down betting
TODO: implement payouts
TODO: write better unit tests






TODO: Generate Test data for basic Feed Forward Neural Net
    -Feed forward networks have no 'memory' so each hand state
    will act like an independent hand
TODO: Train Neural Net on test data
TODO: Train Neural Net based on Win/Loss to see if it comes up with the same basic strategy
TODO: Add logic for double downs and splits
TODO: Re-do Neural Net with new information
TODO: Implement Hi-Lo Card Count and other card counting systems
TODO: Test Nueral net efficiency with new information
TODO: Implement RNN with all information.
TODO: Test different training strategies and see what is best
TODO: Build Neural Net for betting strategies
TODO: Throw it all together in a DQRNN maybe
